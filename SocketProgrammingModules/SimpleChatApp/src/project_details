Project
-------
A simple chat app currently I'm just focusing on the connectivity part where in I will be implementing
various ways to establish connections with some real world problems. [Transport layer]


Features to implement
---------------------
1. TCP socket connection to provide a basic client server connections
2. UDP socket connection 
3. Multi-threaded servers ( one thread per client )
4. Secure sockets with SSL
5. Java nio for non-blocking communication 
6. Object serialization (Send objects over socket )
7. Hearbeat mechanism ( Detect dead clients )
8. Integrate web client (web sockets)


Part 1
------
1. simple single way connection from client to server
