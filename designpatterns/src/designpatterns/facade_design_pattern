Facade Design Pattern
---------------------
Facade Method Design Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. 
Facade defines a high-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. 


Components
----------
1. Facade 
* Facade knows which subsystem classes are responsible for the request
* It delegate client requests to appropriate subsystem objects.

2.Subsystem classes
* It implements subsystem functionality
* It handle work assigned by the facade
* It have no knowledge about the facade that is they have no reference to it

3. Interface
* The Interface in the Facade Design Pattern refers to the set of simplified methods that the facade exposes to the client.
* It hides the complexities of the subsystem, ensuring that clients interact only with high-level operations, 
  without dealing with the underlying details of the system.



Facade Method Design Pattern collaborate in different way **

* Client communicate with the subsystem by sending requests to Facade, which forwards them to the appropriate subsystem objects.
* The Facade may have to do work of its own to translate it inheritance to subsystem interface.
* Clients that use the Facade donâ€™t have to access its subsystem objects directly.
