Problem Statement:
------------------
Design a weather monitoring system where multiple display modules (like current conditions, statistics, and forecast displays) 
automatically update themselves whenever the central weather station receives new weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure). 
Use the Observer Design Pattern to implement this behavior.
