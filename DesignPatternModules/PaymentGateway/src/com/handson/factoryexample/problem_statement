Problem Statement:

Design a Payment Gateway System that supports multiple payment methods such as Credit Card, UPI, Net Banking, and Wallets.
 Each payment method has a distinct way of processing the transaction. The system should allow dynamic registration of new payment types (e.g., Crypto, PayLater)
 without modifying existing logic, and should enable clients to process a payment using a simple string identifier (e.g., "upi", "credit").
