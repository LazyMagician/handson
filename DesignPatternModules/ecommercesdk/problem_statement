Problem Statement:

You are integrating a third-party payment gateway into your existing e-commerce application.
Your application expects a PaymentProcessor interface with a method processPayment(amount), but
the new payment gateway SDK uses a different interface with a method makeTransaction(value). Design a solution using the
Adapter Design Pattern to allow seamless integration without modifying your existing application code.
