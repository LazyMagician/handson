Problem Statement:

Design a logging utility for an application where all components must write logs to a single, shared log file. 
Ensure that only one instance of the logger exists throughout the application lifecycle, even when accessed by multiple threads concurrently.

Components:
1. Logger - interface 
2. SimpleLogger - class
3. Service - interface
4. Client Service
5. Core Service
6. External Service
