Problem Statement
-----------------
An e-commerce platform needs to calculate shipping costs based on different strategies
such as standard shipping, express shipping, and free shipping promotions.
The calculation logic varies depending on the chosen strategy and may change over time. 
To keep the system flexible and maintainable, the platform should allow selecting or changing 
the shipping cost calculation strategy dynamically without altering the core order processing code.
