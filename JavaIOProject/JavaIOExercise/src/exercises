Java I/O Streams Hands-On Exercises
-----------------------------------

Exercise 1: Copy Text File (Character Stream)
Use BufferedReader and BufferedWriter to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt'.
- Use FileReader/FileWriter for file access.
- Print 'File copied successfully!' after completion.

Exercise 2: Copy Binary File (Byte Stream)
Use FileInputStream and FileOutputStream to copy an image file ('image.jpg' to 'image_copy.jpg').
- Use a byte buffer (e.g., 1024 bytes).
- Handle IOException.

Exercise 3: Write and Read Primitive Data
Use DataOutputStream to write integers and strings to a file 'data.dat'.
Then, use DataInputStream to read and print them.

Exercise 4: Object Serialization
Create a Serializable class (e.g., Student).
- Use ObjectOutputStream to serialize a Student object.
- Use ObjectInputStream to deserialize it and display the contents.

Exercise 5: In-Memory Byte Stream
Use ByteArrayOutputStream to collect strings and convert to byte array.
- Then use ByteArrayInputStream to read them back.
- Useful for buffer-based logic or mocking input.

Bonus Project: Simple Chat Logger
Build a simple console chat logger:
- Accept input from user via BufferedReader(InputStreamReader(System.in)).
- Write chat logs to 'chatlog.txt' using BufferedWriter.
